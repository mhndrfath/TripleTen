# Music Preference Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to compare the music preferences of users in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. Actual Y.Music data will be displayed to test several hypotheses below and compare user behavior in both cities.

**Hypothesis**
- User activity varies depending on the day and city.
- On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville tune in to different genres. This also applies on Friday nights.
- Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, users prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville rap music has more fans.

## Data Description
Dataset is stored in files `music_project.csv`

Column description:

- `userID`— User ID
- `Track`— song track title
- `artist`— artist name
- `genre`
- `City`— the city where the user is located
- `time`— the length of time the song was played
- `Day`— day of the week

## Methodology
- Data Overview (Check general information about dataset)
- Data Pre-Processing (Further check for writing, duplicate, and missing value)
- Testing Hypothesis

## Result
After data analysis and testing the hypothesis, we can conclude:

1. User activity in Springfield and Shelbyville depends on the day.

The first hypothesis can be fully accepted.

2. Music preferences weren't too different during a week in Springfield and Shelbyville. 
We can see a small difference on Monday, but both Springfield and Shelbyville, most people listen to pop music.
So we cannot accept this hypothesis. We also have to remember that the results might have been different if we consider the missing values

3. It turns out that the music preferences of users from Springfield and Shelbyville are very similar.
The third hypothesis is rejected. If there is a difference in preference, it cannot be seen from this data.

### Notes
In real projects, research involves statistical hypothesis testing, which is more precise and more quantitative. Also note that you can't always draw conclusions about an entire city based on data from just one source.
