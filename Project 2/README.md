# Credit Score Analysis

## Project Description
The project involves preparing a report for the bank's credit department to investigate the impact of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of default in repaying a loan. Existing data on customer credit worthiness will be analyzed for this purpose.

The report will be a crucial component in the credit assessment process for potential customers. Credit scoring, utilized to assess a potential borrower's ability to repay their loan, will be informed by the findings of this report.

## Data Description
Dataset is stored in files `credit_scoring.csv`

Column Description :
- `children`: number of children in the family
- `days_employed`: how long the customer has worked
- `dob_years`: customer age
- `education`: customer education level
- `educationid`: identifier for the customer's education level
- `family_status`: customer's marital status
- `family_status_id`: identifier for the customer's marital status
- `gender`: customer gender
- `income_type`: type of customer income
- `debt`: whether the customer has ever defaulted on a loan
- `total_income`: monthly income
- `purpose`: the reason for taking a loan

## Methodology
- Data Overview (Check general information of dataset)
- Data Pre-Processing (Further check for duplicate, unique value, missing value, etc)
- Data Transformation (Data repair processed before filling missing value)
- Data Categorization (Shorten a meaning that has many meanings or has the same meaning)
- Testing Hypothesis

## Result
After analyzing this report, it can be concluded:

1. Having children has a relationship with a higher probability of loan default than not having children
2. Customers who are newly divorced and married have a small probability of default on loans compared to those who are not married, civil unions, and are widows or widowers
3. Low-income customers have a high probability of loan default compared to middle- or high-income customers
4. Loans for vehicles and education have a high probability of default compared to customers who borrow for property and marriage
